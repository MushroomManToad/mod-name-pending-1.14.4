Using the Crafting Table, it should be possible to assemble a Gemstone from this new, dephased material by placing it in a 2x2 square. In fact, the shards combine so readily, even inventory crafting should work for this.";
	public static String GOLD_VIMION_GEMSTONE = "Vimion: a material that emits a strong, unidentified energy when life forms are near it. This energy seems to scale with the size of the life form near it, so its reaction to, for example, a Chicken is far less than its reaction to, say, a Cow. Analysis of this material at the atomic level has revealed that there are, in fact, no atoms involved whatsoever. If this observation is correct, Vimion is the first known material made entirely of Magic in a stable structure." + "\n\n" + "This property seems to be consistent with how malleable Vimion is. While it is most stable in a crystalline gemstone structure, it will readily deform and bind to other substances. This property makes its potential as a tool material by itself small, but the possibility of combining it with other tools to create objects with heightened magical properties is greater than any other known substance!" + "\n\n" + "Research into this substance is certain to yield fascinating results!";

However, even more importantly, this \"Advanced\" Geologic Phaser has been reported to be able to dephase at least four new ores. As such, new objectives have been added to this Tome for each of these. It's time to head back down to the caves to try to locate these new materials with the Advanced Geologic Phaser, and to try to discover their properties and uses!";

This can now be done on any standard crafting table by using Vimion Gemstones and a Stick in the same way you would craft a Diamond Sword from Diamonds and a Stick. A dagger that kills things while it emits a strong life-based energy should have some interesting effect, right?";
	public static String GOLD_SPIRITS_QUESTION = "It took almost a week for anyone to find something truly remarkable about this new tool, and interestingly, it was the wife of a farmer that lost his mind and slaughtered all of his livestock with his Vimionite Dagger. In the aftermath of the destruction, his wife noticed that among the raw beef, pork, chicken, mutton, and rabbit, there were small, glowing, green objects." + "\n\n" + "These were eventually confirmed to be chunks of the Vimion Dagger that had broken off at the time of the animals' death and bound to their souls, trapping them in our universe.
