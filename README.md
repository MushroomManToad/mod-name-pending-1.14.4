Vimion Mod

Concept

	In the outer regions of Minecraftia, a block of stone was uncovered that glowed with a faint green hue. 
	This stone block fortunately caught the attention of the miners, and rather than smashing the rock to cobblestone, 
	they decided to carefully extract the stone and take it to a nearby WabCorp lab for a closer examination. 
	After a careful study of its energy readings, it was determined that this stone block contained a massive sample of 
	a gemstone just slightly out of phase with our universe. 

	Soon after, a method was developed to draw the stones into our world. Early observations revealed several details 
	that make the gems unique. First and foremost, they output a previously unknown form of energy, and this energy 
	output gets stronger the closer the stone is brought to large life forms (such as animals or trees). 
	For these reasons, the gemstone was named Vimion, with vim referring to the energy of life, and ion referring to the gem’s ability to store, transfer, and radiate energy. It is not yet fully known what this energy can be used for, nor what other secrets the extradimensional gemstone may yet hold.

	Over the next several years, a tool was developed to facilitate the stabilization of this gem and draw it fully into the universe. This tool, the Geologic Phaser, has now been made available for the people of all regions of Minecraftia to use on stone blocks found in the depths of the world to try to locate more samples of the mysterious gemstone. Over time, knowledge of its properties and uses is sure to grow as more samples are collected from all across Minecraftia! 

	The task now falls to you, Miner. Dare to venture into the deepest reaches of the world to unearth the hidden Vimionite Ore, and harness the gemstone’s powers to create blocks and items with the potential to revolutionize the way we perceive and interact with reality!
